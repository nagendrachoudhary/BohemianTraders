Created `Bohemiantraders.com` clone, this is our collaborative week project with a team of 4 members here we have made a fully responsive react-redux e-commerce website clone with all CRUD-based functionality.

We made this entire multipage react website in a week and tried to reach as close as possible to the actual website, it's not fair to say that we have created the same website but from the UI perspective and by concluding all the frontend functionality, yes proudly it is a clone.

## Conclusion

After working on the project I came to know how important is teamwork. During the making of the project if any member faced any difficulty others always try to help him.

I came to know the real meaning of TEAM:- Together Everyone Achieves More.

Every team member gave his best in order to make the project as good as it could be.

The project repository is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/krishnachaturvedi1901/Bohemiantraders-website-clone).
